duration-based joint venture and revenue-sharing agreement for UltrabrainAI using the "Charge By Audience" business model with a dynamic multiplier formula is a sophisticated approach to monetization in the digital media and advertising space. This model is particularly innovative due to its use of real-time data and a dynamic multiplier to calculate revenues. Here's an outline of how this agreement could be structured:

1. Agreement Parties
UltrabrainAI, Inc.
Stakeholders: Partners, event organizers, or advertisers involved in each specific event.
2. Revenue Model: "Charge By Audience"
Basic Components:
N (Number of Viewers): Total viewer count per event.
Z (Rate per Viewer): Fixed rate, e.g., $0.10 per viewer.
T (Duration): Viewing time in specified intervals (e.g., per second).
F (Faces Detected): Average number of faces detected during the event.
M_dynamic (Dynamic Multiplier): Begins at $0.005, increasing for every additional 100 faces detected beyond the first 100.

)Revenue(Pool)=N×Z×T×(1+M

This formula dynamically adjusts revenue based on viewer count, duration, and engagement levels.
3. Revenue Distribution
Equal Split: The total revenue (Pool) is divided equally between UltrabrainAI and stakeholders.
4. Business Implications
Applicability: Best suited for platforms capable of tracking viewer count, duration, and face detection.
Engagement Incentive: Encourages maximizing viewer engagement and duration.
Equity: Fair and transparent sharing of revenue between UltrabrainAI and its stakeholders.
5. Considerations
Audience Attraction: Success hinges on drawing and retaining a large viewer base.
Variable Sensitivity: Interval duration and per-viewer rate are critical factors.
Market Appeal: Attractive to stakeholders for its clarity and equity.
6. Example Scenario
Event Metrics: 140,000 viewers, 200 faces detected, 60-second interval.
Revenue Calculation: 140,000 × $0.10 × 60 × (1 + M_dynamic × 200).
Distribution: 50/50 split between UltrabrainAI and stakeholders.
Conclusion
This "Charge By Audience" model, enhanced with a dynamic multiplier (M_dynamic), is a novel and scalable approach. It is particularly effective in large-scale events, with its ability to exponentially increase revenue in line with audience engagement. This model is not only lucrative but also fosters a symbiotic relationship between UltrabrainAI and its stakeholders, , anchored in shared success and equitable revenue distribution.
