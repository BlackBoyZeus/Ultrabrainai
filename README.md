The phenomenon crowdface envelopes, related to the popularity of a live stream event and the premium advertisers are willing to pay during its duration, can be linked to the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. Dopamine plays a key role in the brain's reward system and is associated with pleasure, motivation, and reinforcement of rewarding behaviors. In the context of a live stream event with high viewership, individuals experience a sense of anticipation and excitement, triggering the release of dopamine. The unpredictability of live events and the immediacy of real-time engagement contribute to heightened levels of dopamine. As viewers watch and engage with the content, their brains may reward them with positive feelings, reinforcing continued attention. Advertisers recognize the potential impact of this neurobiological response. Placing ads during a popular live stream allows them to capitalize on the increased attention and engagement, as viewers are more likely to respond positively to stimuli during this heightened state of arousal. Hence, advertisers are willing to pay a premium to associate their products or services with the positive emotions and attention generated during such high-profile events.
