Compression Δ

The crowdface is a new means of distribution, I.e. distribution channel. Companies like snap, TikTok and legacy media as well as various other sector(s) have created billion in value from owning the highest distribution ability and speed but have also largely been infra-slow  due to the dependency on a platform economy is form factor limitations. Amazingly we have discovered a lightweight device for consuming branded content of advertisements and deploys them swiftly in a psychologically sticker fashion that leverages the technical components of advertising, with more modern habits of consumption as a delivery vehicle. Also the ability to compress a time Δ into a network stream for inference suggests, the scalable compound mechanics on time spend, growth, expense, earnings, over time as well as the collective health of the modern consumer in a n age of information, overlap where the visual comms ability of the meme, suggests the-crowdface is a natural next step in our evolution cycle. 

As evidenced by modern aims boom cycle we are moving toward a gilded age of compression Δ where compression represents the value ascertained from experience. The ability to compress, time, experience, and information in a more compact device is the transformation that the iPhone brought about  .and something that trailed off as the world grew used to such compression. Companies like Tesla represent another face of compression Δ, the experience compressed into the sustainable architecture is something akin to eh superiority of Chinese engineering. When compression, meets distribution, velocity max is achieved and a populous audience is transformed into critical mass. The scalar vectors in time space become instead of a physical friction barrier a signal=noise ratio when the clearest signal wins. Heightened communication in the age of memetic. The crowdface instantiates a much clearer & decisive way to surmise value.

Crowdface is the newest distribution channel for advertisement these is, & this is merely the early stages of what it will ultimately become. Unique opportunity to be bltizscale visibly, leveraging established core advances . Light fast branding ability . In the new age, speed and shape of communication matter tremendously. Those who deliver their message fast and more creatively, see more responsive consumer behavior in a modern era.


The phenomenon crowdface envelopes, related to the popularity of a live stream event and the premium advertisers are willing to pay during its duration, can be linked to the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. Dopamine plays a key role in the brain's reward system and is associated with pleasure, motivation, and reinforcement of rewarding behaviors. In the context of a live stream event with high viewership, individuals experience a sense of anticipation and excitement, triggering the release of dopamine. The unpredictability of live events and the immediacy of real-time engagement contribute to heightened levels of dopamine. As viewers watch and engage with the content, their brains may reward them with positive feelings, reinforcing continued attention. Advertisers recognize the potential impact of this neurobiological response. Placing ads during a popular live stream allows them to capitalize on the increased attention and engagement, as viewers are more likely to respond positively to stimuli during this heightened state of arousal. Hence, advertisers are willing to pay a premium to associate their products or services with the positive emotions and attention generated during such high-profile events.
